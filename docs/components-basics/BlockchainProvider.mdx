# Overview
The BlockchainProvider must be placed at the root of your component tree to ensure all child components have access to the same blockchain configuration and state.

# Usage
```typescript
import { BlockchainProvider, ConnectButton } from '@easya/layer-ui-react';

const config = {
  network: 'testnet',
  blockchain: 'xrpl',
  wallet: 'crossmark'
};

function App() {
  return (
    <BlockchainProvider config={config}>
      <ConnectButton />
    </BlockchainProvider>
  );
}
```


1. network: it can be testnet or mainnet
